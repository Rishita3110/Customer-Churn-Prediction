# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the most important business problems in subscription-based industries. Churn occurs when customers stop using a company's services, resulting in revenue loss and increased customer acquisition costs.

This project aims to predict customer churn using Machine Learning techniques. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, model evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze customer behavior and identify factors contributing to churn.
* Build machine learning models to predict customer churn.
* Compare multiple classification algorithms.
* Deploy the best-performing model as an interactive web application.

# 🤖 Machine Learning Models

Three classification algorithms were implemented and compared:

### 1. Logistic Regression

A baseline linear classification model used for churn prediction.

### 2. Decision Tree Classifier

A tree-based model capable of capturing non-linear relationships.

### 3. Random Forest Classifier

An ensemble learning model that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and robustness.
